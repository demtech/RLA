Risk Limiting Audits for Denmark

This repository contains all source code that we used to audit the 
Referendum and the European Parliament Election 2014 in Denmark. 

We implemented all software packages indpendently twice, without any sharing of code.  Both implementations were initialized with the same parameters
alpha = 0.001  (as the risk-limit), which means that we can be sure with 
a confidence of 99.9 that the system computed the same result.
